2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,990
Welcome to the next part of the
introduction section.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,520
Which outlines the course prerequisites
and learning strategies.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,340
In this part, we'll explain the
background, students

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,260
taking this MOCC are expected to have, and
provide

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,630
some tips to help students learn the
material

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,810
covered in the videos, and successfully
complete the assignments.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,540
When we teach classes on mobile cloud
computing with Android.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,910
At Vanderbilt University, and the
University of Maryland, we

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,320
can rely on the students having taken the
prerequisites.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,420
In contrast, one of the challenges of
teaching a MOOC, is that we don't

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,170
really know what you know, and whether

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,150
you're prepared to master the topics we
cover.

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,580
We developed this MOOC, with certain
assumptions about, and expectations

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,090
of students who take this course, which
are summarized here.

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,480
To help align our expectations, here are
some things we'd like you to know.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,913
To get the most out of this MOOC.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,120
First and foremost, it's essential for you
to have a good understanding

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,440
of object oriented programming in general,

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,350
and the Java programming language in
particular.

21
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,390
For example, you need to understand

22
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,830
Java features like classes, inheritance,
dynamic

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,360
binding and generics, so you can follow
along with the examples we cover.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,300
It's also important to understand core

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,210
Android programming elements, such as
activities, intense,

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,110
and user interface components, as well

27
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,230
as the Eclipse Android development tools
environment.

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,570
If you're rusty on these topics, we
strongly

29
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,140
recommend you leverage resources available
on the web.

30
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,950
Starting with those summarized

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,185
at this link.

32
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:50,700
[MUSIC]

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,610
In addition to being proficient with Java,
it's also useful to understand

34
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,370
fundamental object oriented design
concepts, such

35
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,970
as encapsulation, abstraction,
polymorphism, and extensibility.

36
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,680
Object oriented design is a method of
planning

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,990
a system with interacting objects to solve
software problems,

38
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,400
by specifying crisply defined conceptual
boundaries, that combine

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,220
methods and data, to hide information
likely to change.

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,630
Thereby minimizing rework.

41
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,160
As requirements and environments evolve,
as described at this link.

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,250
Likewise, knowledge of class and sequence
diagrams, defined by the Unified

43
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,850
Modeling Language, or UML, will help you
understand the structure and interactions.

44
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,980
Between key elements of the Java and

45
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,680
Android examples, we analyze throughout
this MOOC.

46
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,578
You don't need to be a UML expert to make

47
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:39,602
sense of these examples, but we recommend
you read the material

48
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:42,570
available on UML available at this link,
and on other websites

49
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,069
and books, so you'll understand the
notations used in our diagrams.

50
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,540
Finally, it would be helpful, if you're

51
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,820
familiar with common systems and network
programming concepts

52
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,510
and mechanisms, such as event loops,
multi-threading, multi-processing,

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,240
synchronization, scheduling and local and
remote interprocess communication.

54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,430
You don't need a deep background in these
areas.

55
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,100
Since we'll review them as needed
throughout this MOOC.

56
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,845
However, if you're interested in learning
more about these topics, section

57
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:14,550
one of the 2013 POSA MOOC, provides an
overview at this

58
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,090
link.

59
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,590
[MUSIC].

60
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,480
This MOOC covers a lot of material, and
some

61
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,530
requires a lot of thinking and practice to
master.

62
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,780
Even if you've successfully completed
Professor Porter's MOOC.

63
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,310
To help you learn all this material, here
are

64
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,960
some strategies you should consider, when
taking this MOOC.

65
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,180
First, watch the lectures carefully,
perhaps multiple times.

66
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,480
And at different rates of speed, to fully
comprehend the topics that we're covering.

67
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,060
Many topics are technically deep,
especially

68
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,360
concurrency, interprocess communication,
and application security.

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,410
Although we can't possible address all
aspects

70
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,110
of this material in our limited time
together.

71
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,810
You may benefit from learning more about

72
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,860
these topics, either during, or after this
MOOC.

73
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,230
Therefore, many slides contain links to
articles, documentation, and

74
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,410
source code that you can read as time
permits.

75
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,100
However, no quiz questions relate to this
material,

76
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,579
so feel free to read it at your leisure.

77
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,120
Additional tips for learning the material
in the videos, appear at this

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,080
link.

79
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,820
[MUSIC].

80
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,208
Although reading the freely available
material

81
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,190
online is helpful, more comprehensive
information,

82
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,550
can often be found in the recommended
reading list, that appears here.

83
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,060
On the POSA MOOC home page.

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
I encourage you to read these books, to
gain even

85
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,890
more insights into the material we cover
in the lectures.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,550
I also urge you to seek out Coursera

87
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,780
meetup groups in your area, which are
summarized here.

88
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,210
Where you can get together face to face
with fellow

89
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,679
students, and further immerse yourselves
in the topics we cover.

90
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,470
Another way to make this MOOC feel more
like a face to face course, is to attend

91
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,010
virtual office hours, where we'll answer
your questions, and

92
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:15,220
lead impromptu discussions live, via
Google Hangout and YouTube.

93
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,930
All virtual office hours will also be
recorded and uploaded to the

94
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,900
POSA website, so you can watch them at
your convenience, as described here.

95
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,090
Even if you aren't able to join us live,
we encourage

96
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,760
you to participate in the online
discussion forums, where you can interact

97
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,250
with other students, post questions, give
answers, clarify points of confusion,

98
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,550
and learn who else is wrestling with the
same challenges as you.

99
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,800
We regularly monitor the forums, and we'll
provide tips

100
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,150
and pointers, to mentor you through the
learning process.

101
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,510
However, there are only a handful of us,

102
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,350
but tens of thousands of you, so please
read

103
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,480
our policies on the forum postings at this

104
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,910
link, and be respectful of fellow students
and staff.

105
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,371
[MUSIC]

106
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:07,690
In summary, our goal on teaching this
MOOC, is to help as many students

107
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,610
as possible, gain access to a world

108
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,229
class education, on mobile cloud computing
with Android.

109
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,120
However, the topics we cover are
technically deep, and take time to master.

110
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,240
So, we encourage you to leverage multiple
sources of learning,

111
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,600
many of which are listed in the FAQ at
this link.

112
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,660
I strongly encourage you to read the
entire FAQ, since it

113
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,050
provides a wealth of information to help
you succeed in this MOOC.

114
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,944
If you're inspired to learn more about
mobile cloud computing with Android,

115
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:40,074
and associated topics like patterns and
frameworks, I recommend you check out the

116
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,375
digital learning resources available at
this

117
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,440
link, which provide dozens more hours of

118
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,006
videos and screencasts on object oriented
design and programming with Java and C++.

119
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:53,380
Patterns and frameworks for concurrent and
network software,

120
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,678
and Android middle ware and systems
programming mechanisms.
