Welcome to the module on Java Concurrency
Mechanisms.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,800
At the core of Android's concurrency

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,890
infrastructure, are standard Java language
and library

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,370
features that create and manage threads,
as

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,439
well as synchronize and schedule their
interactions.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,200
This module presents an overview of these
Java Concurrency

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,370
Mechanisms, focusing on the core
properties of Java threads

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,200
and key Java synchronizers and scheduling
mechanisms, such as

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,380
Reentrant locks, condition objects,
semaphores,

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,950
and synchronized methods and statements.

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,250
It also shows many examples of applying
these

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,770
mechanisms in applications, and the
Android middleware, to develop

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,340
effective and correct concurrent software,
as well as demonstrating

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,166
problems that arise when these mechanisms
are applied incorrectly.

16
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:54,000
In addition, we discussed how Java
Concurrency

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,880
Mechanisms are enhanced by the application
of common

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,672
Gang of Four and posted patterns, such as
template method, strategy,

19
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:09,824
factory method, and monitor object.
