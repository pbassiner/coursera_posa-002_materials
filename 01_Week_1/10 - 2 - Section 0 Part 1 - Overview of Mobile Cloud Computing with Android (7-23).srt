00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:08,313
Welcome to the first part of the
Introduction section, which provides an

3
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:15,720
overview of our mobile cloud computing
with Android specialization.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,160
Everyday millions of people around the
world, use handheld smartphone

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,400
and tablet devices, that are increasingly
based on the Android platform.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,369
As shown at this link.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,250
These Android devices run software
applications, that direct users to

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,280
the places they want to go, securely
provide information about the

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,440
people, locations, goods and services near
them, and help them

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,340
interact with the people they care about,
and do business with.

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,670
These applications increasingly rely on
three synergistic

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,718
computing technologies, collectively known
as mobile cloud computing.

13
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:52,430
Where applications are designed to run on
smart mobile devices,

14
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,340
connected to elastic computing services,

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,390
that are accessible over wireless
networks.

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,970
Mobile cloud computing, represents the
confluence

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,090
of advances in multicore and distributed

18
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,460
core processors, inexpensive mass storage,
ubiquitous

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,330
wireless connectivity, and commodity
harbor platforms.

20
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,180
The demand for applications that run on
these platforms is

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,370
growing rapidly, which is motivating the
need for software practitioners

22
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,580
and researchers, who understand how to
develop concurrent and network

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,440
software for mobile devices, that connect
to powerful cloud platforms.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,870
However, despite continuous improvements
in hardware and

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,930
software infrastructure, it remains
frustratingly hard to develop

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,780
high quality software applications, for
mobile devices

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,668
and computing clouds, on time and under
budget.

28
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,962
The impediments to success in this domain,

29
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:46,558
arise from various inherent and accidental
complexities, ranging

30
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:50,030
from self-inflicted limitations with
tedious and error-prone

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,810
techniques tools and methods used to
develop software.

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,410
To fundamental challenges of concurrency
and resilience that scale.

33
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:57,942
[MUSIC]

34
00:01:57,942 --> 00:02:00,694
To help meet the needs and overcome the

35
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:05,682
impediments outlined earlier, I've teamed
up with professor Adam

36
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:10,584
Porter from the University of Maryland,
and Professor Jules White

37
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:16,220
from Vanderbilt University, to create a
Coursera specialization.

38
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,750
It covers many techniques, tools, and
methods, aimed at alleviating the

39
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,920
inherent and accidental complexities of
developing

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,940
mobile cloud computing applications with
Android.

41
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,680
Specializations are a new form of MOOC.

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,780
Aimed at fostering collaborations among

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,470
teachers and students, that span
traditional

44
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,060
inter and intra-institution and
disciplinary

45
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,410
boundaries, as described at this link.

46
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:41,550
The first MOOC in this sequence, the

47
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,700
University of Maryland's course,
Programming Mobile Applications for

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,630
Android Handheld Systems, taught by
Professor Porter, focused

49
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,490
on the design and implementation of
user-facing applications.

50
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,020
Covering the fundamental programming
principles,

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,200
software architecture, and user experience

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,470
considerations underlying handheld
software applications,

53
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,809
in the Android development environment.

54
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,240
The first lecture of week one of Professor
Porter's MOOC, presents an overview of the

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,900
Android platform, which you should watch
to

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,980
understand the key components in Android's
software architecture.

57
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:18,780
The second MOOC on programming mobile
services for Android handheld systems,

58
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,060
is being taught by me and Professor White,
from Vanderbilt University.

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,810
We focus on a range of Android application
and middle work programming topics.

60
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,090
Including threading and concurrency
control mechanisms, background

61
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,900
service processing, local interprocess
communication, and application security.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,990
This MOOC builds upon and extends the

63
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,550
user-facing applications, covered earlier
in Professor Porter's MOOC.

64
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,920
Diving deeper into the guts of Android's
powerful middle work platform.

65
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,985
For example, we focus on how Android
combines

66
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:52,900
advances in hardware and software
infrastructure support for concurrency.

67
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,730
Together with pattern arc software
architecture and framework techniques.

68
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,930
To improve the performance,
responsiveness, security

69
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,190
and structure of mobile applications, so
they

70
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,620
are more efficient, resilient and easier
to evolve over the software life cycle.

71
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,265
[MUSIC].

72
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:14,036
>> Hi, I'm Jules White, and I'm teaming up
with Doug Schmidt to teach the

73
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:21,490
third MOOC in the mobile cloud computing
with Android specialization.

74
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,840
Entitled, Programming Cloud Services for
Android Handheld Systems.

75
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,150
This MOOC rounds out our coverage of
mobile cloud

76
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,430
computing, by focusing on how to connect
mobile devices

77
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,890
to cloud computing and data storage
resources, turning a

78
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,710
mobile device into an extension of
powerful cloud-based services.

79
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,120
We'll extend the handheld systems topics
covered in the first two

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,710
MOOCs, to focus on architectures for
communicating with the cloud using HDP.

81
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,620
Server side processing of mobile data,
using serverlets and the Java spring

82
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,460
framework, in scalable storage of data,

83
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,180
using no SQL databases and other
platforms.

84
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,432
Since building a slow or insecure mobile
cloud application is unacceptable.

85
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:07,630
This MOOC will not only show you how to
program handheld program systems

86
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,312
that talk to the cloud, but how to do it
securely, scalably, and efficiently.

87
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,630
This speciation has three MOOCs, plus a
Capstone project.

88
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,020
Signature track students, who receive a
verified

89
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,330
certificate with distinction in three
MOOCs, can combine

90
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,850
what they've learned to build a complete

91
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,840
mobile cloud computing application, from
the ground up.

92
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,480
[MUSIC].

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,920
>> The material covered in our MOOC
specialization,

94
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,970
is based on experience we've gained during
the

95
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,650
past several decades researching,
developing, and applying concurrent

96
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,310
and network software, written in C++ and
Java.

97
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,510
The software we've developed has been used
by thousands of projects around the world.

98
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,910
Often, for mission critical systems, where
the right

99
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,619
answered delivered too late, becomes the
wrong answer.

100
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,380
We're delighted to have the opportunity to
share

101
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,640
the key techniques and practices, we've
devised and learned

102
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,020
over the years, to help you become more

103
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,420
effective, at developing software for
mobile devices and clouds.

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,160
In our experience, the principles,
methods,

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,030
and skills required to develop such
software.

106
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,300
Are best learned by attaining mastery of
patterns and frameworks.

107
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,870
A pattern describes a reasonable solution
to a common problem that

108
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,930
arises within a particular context, which
can be as broad as

109
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,110
the domain of mobile cloud computing, or
as narrow as ensuring

110
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,226
Android smartphone users, are informed
when their battery levels are low.

111
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,590
A framework is an integrated set of
components, that collaborate to

112
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,750
provide a reuseable architecture, for our

113
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,750
family of related applications or
services.

114
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,160
Frameworks can also be viewed as concrete
realizations of pattern,

115
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,290
that facilitate directory use of detail
designs and source code.

116
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,030
We look forward to interacting with you
over the next several months.

117
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,060
To help you learn and apply these patterns
and frameworks in your own work on mobile

118
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,285
cloud computing with Android, just as we
do

119
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:08,300
at Vanderbilt University, and the
University of Maryland.

120
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,660
You'll not only become more productive,
but you'll also have a

121
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,430
lot more fun, and look at the world in new
ways.
