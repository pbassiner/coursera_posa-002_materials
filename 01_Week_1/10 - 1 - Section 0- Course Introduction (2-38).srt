00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,910
Hello, my name is Doug Schmitt.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:15,330
And I'd like to welcome you to our MOOC on
programming mobile services for

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,300
Android handheld systems, which focuses on
a

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,950
range of Android application and
middleware programming topics.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,140
Including threading and concurrency
control mechanisms, background

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,920
service processing, local inter-process
communication, and application security.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,340
This is the second course in our

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,080
specialization on mobile cloud computing
with Android.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,450
Which is the first trans-institutional
sequence of

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,800
MOOCs taught on the Coursera platform by

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,210
myself, Professor Adam Porter at
University of

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,210
Maryland, and Professor Jules White at
Vanderbilt University.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,820
Before we delve into techniques, tools,
and methods associated

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,630
with the program and concurrent
applications and services on Android.

16
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,840
This section gives an overview of the
entire

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,850
specialization in general, and this MOOC
in particular.

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,220
We start by outlining how the MOOCs in our
specialization built upon

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,150
and codified decades of research and

20
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,560
development we've conducted together and
separately.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,460
To provide you with an integrated learning
experience that blends coverage

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,960
of software design and architecture,

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,420
human computer interaction, accessibility
and useability.

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,000
Java programming language features and

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,850
idioms, communication and concurrency
patterns and

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,320
frameworks, database design and
programming techniques,

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,010
cyber security, automated testing and
more.

28
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,440
Next, I'll explain the course

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,860
organization, assignments and assessment
methods.

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,350
As well as outline the main topics in each
section.

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,180
Since teaching and taking MOOCs is
different from traditional face

32
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,330
to face courses, I'll also explain this
course's prerequisites and expectations.

33
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,230
As well as provide some tips on how to
leverage online resources to

34
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,800
master the material we cover in the

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,930
videos and successfully complete the
programming assignments.

36
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,280
Finally, I'll present an overview of
patterns and frameworks.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,185
Which are topics that underline most
material in this MOOC.

38
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,828
Throughout this MOOC, we'll analyze dozens

39
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:09,360
of pattern-oriented Java and Android
applications.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,080
Some of which we've developed.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,990
And others that reside in Android's
middleware, class libraries

42
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,320
and packaged applications which apply many
patterns and frameworks.

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,862
These examples showcase the pattern

44
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:24,930
software architecture techniques, tools,
and methods you

45
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,818
need to successfully develop your own

46
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:29,930
concurrent mobile applications and
services on Android.
