3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,360
Welcome to the first module in the section
on Android concurrency.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,800
This module summarizes key concurrency
motivations

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,960
and challenges to provide a conceptual
overview

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,610
before we delve into the numerous

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,000
details and examples of Android
concurrency mechanisms.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,680
Frameworks and patterns in the rest of
this section.

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,650
The advent of multicore and distributed
core processors is increasing the demand

10
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,070
for practitioners and researchers who
understand

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,500
how to develop and deploy concurrent
software.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,600
That takes full advantage of the
underlying hardware.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,400
For example, many cell phones and laptops

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,730
have quad core processors, many desktops
and servers

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,200
have eight to twelve cores, and computer

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,940
devices with many more cores are coming
soon.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,390
However.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,430
Despite continuous improvements in
hardware during the past four decades,

19
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,740
it's frustratingly hard to develop quality
concurrent software for mobile devices.

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,950
This module explains why you should expend
the time

21
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,129
and effort learning how to develop
concurrent mobile device software.

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,570
We also explore common challenges that
you'll

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,950
need to understand in order to master key

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,220
accidental and inherent complexities that
arise when

25
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,580
you develop this type of software on
Android.
