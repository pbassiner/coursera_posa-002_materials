2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,936
Malware developers will go to great
lengths

3
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:15,090
to try to get malware onto your device.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,010
So one of the user manipulation attacks
that they've started to employ.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,810
Is to use your trust in different devices
that you

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,920
already own in order to get you to install
malware.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,040
So one of the most sophisticated versions
of these attacks is through a technique

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,628
that's called cross-platform malware.

9
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:45,760
And what these attacks do is, they first
get you

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,022
to, using various means, install some
malware

11
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:55,790
on your traditional computing equipment.

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,510
Something like a laptop here.

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,440
And then, what they do is they wait for
you to go.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,310
And visit some website or other location
that you trust.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,263
So for example lets say that you go and
browse in your web browser to your bank.

16
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:17,297
And when you get the your bank the malware
on

17
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:23,130
your laptop identifies that you have just
browsed your banking website.

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,890
And they use that opportunity and the
trust that you have with your

19
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,490
bank to try to trick you into installing
malware on your mobile device.

20
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,430
And the common way that they do it is,
they'll wait until you visit your bank.

21
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,162
And then, they'll display a QR code
telling

22
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:43,930
you that if you'll scan this QR code.

23
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,770
You can install the bank's app and manage
your account remotely.

24
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,910
Now, as a user you feel like this must be
a legitimate

25
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,040
request, to install that bank's app,

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,520
because you just browsed your banking
website.

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,700
But what you don't realize is that this
malware is lurking on your device.

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,710
Waiting for you to go to that website, so
that it can display

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,310
that fake message to you at exactly the
moment that you'll trust it most.

30
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,601
So it'll display that fake message to you
right when you visit your bank's website.

31
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:21,060
When you'll be more trusting of the
message to install an arbitrary app.

32
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,976
So they'll display a QR code that links to
the

33
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:28,770
app store of your choice to download that
particular malware.

34
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,730
And then that malware will then propagate
to your phone.

35
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,560
And now, at this point, the attacker has a
very powerful position.

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,708
They have both your traditional computing
environment, like your

37
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:48,460
laptop, infected and they have your mobile
phone infected.

38
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,870
And your Android phone now has malware on
it

39
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,000
that they can use to help perform complex
attacks.

40
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,743
One of the complex attacks that's been
seen in the

41
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:04,052
wild is to go and initiate a fraudulent
banking transaction.

42
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:09,170
To take money from your account and
deposit it, in the attackers account.

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,900
And a lot of banks, what they'll do is
they'll

44
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,197
require that if you're going to initiate
some large transfer.

45
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:26,190
That you have an SMS sent to your device
that has a code in it.

46
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,230
That you need to type into the website in
order to

47
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,390
authorize and prove that this transaction
is really coming from you.

48
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,849
And now what they can do is if they've got
you

49
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,187
to install the malware on both your device
and your laptop.

50
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:47,750
When that SMS is sent to your device, the
malware can receive that code.

51
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,078
Forward it back to your device, your
laptop or other device,

52
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:57,700
in order to be fed into the website, and
complete the transaction.

53
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,505
So, malware isn't just about gaining
access to one device, but it

54
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:06,822
may be access to gaining multiple devices
on it that you own.

55
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:09,822
And using the trust that you have in each
of

56
00:04:09,822 --> 00:04:15,154
the individual devices to further its
spread across your other devices.

57
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:19,091
And then, using the trust that other
entities like your

58
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:23,630
bank have in your mobile device to
complete fraudulent activity
