2
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:14,297
Let's talk about some news stories that
have been out on the Internet about

3
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:20,400
different security issues that we've seen
with some production apps.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,570
These are some pretty big name apps that
have had security

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,270
issues and we don't want to write apps
that have these same flaws.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,830
Now the specific type of flaw that we're
going to

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,640
look at in this case is called a privilege
escalation.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,880
Now you may say well, I would never

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,640
write an app that would accidentally have
this flaw.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,150
But the reality is these are very subtle
mistakes that developers make.

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,004
Where they don't realize the ramifications
of

12
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:52,428
the decisions they're making, particularly
when they

13
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:57,780
let other apps talk to their app in order
to access services within their app.

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,130
It's very easy to make mistakes.

15
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,390
To accidentally break things like the
permissions model in Android.

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,150
Now you may say, I'll never do that.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,740
Let's show you how you could accidentally
and

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,990
inadvertently do something like this with
the iRemember app.

19
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,958
Let's talk about two services that we
could extend the

20
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:23,936
iRemember app with, that might seem benign
and very helpful

21
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:26,744
to other apps on the device, but that we
can

22
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:31,190
actually show will create a security issue
on the device.

23
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,660
So let's talk about these two services
that we're going to extend

24
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,120
the iRemember app with and then use as an
example of poor security.

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,429
So the first one is we decide that we'd
like to be able to share stories via

26
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:50,402
an intent so that other apps that allow
you to compose a story and maybe

27
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:55,810
attach a photo to a story can simply send
an intent to this service.

28
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,610
So they'll send and intent and that intent
will have a story plus a photo.

29
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,790
And then the service will go off and share
that

30
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,150
story and that photo that the other app
sent to us.

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,916
Now, let's further assume that, you know,
to

32
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,764
be really flexible, we decide that we
want to create

33
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:19,216
a version of the iRemember app that can
share

34
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:23,130
stories and photos to different servers on
the Internet.

35
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,860
So we don't want to control all of the
iRemember servers.

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,444
We want to have, maybe, iRemember servers
that are for Vanderbilt

37
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:32,452
University or a set of iRemember servers
that are for the

38
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,332
University of Maryland, because we want to
be able to

39
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:39,670
have different sets of stories and
photographs, depending on the location.

40
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,370
And we decide we don't want to centrally
manage all of that information.

41
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,870
So one of the things that we could do on
this intent is we could allow it to

42
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,680
also include the URL of the server that we

43
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,850
want to share that story and that photo
with.

44
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,960
And then what we would do is actually when
this intent gets sent to the

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,460
service to share the story and photo, it

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,280
would go off and would access the
Internet.

47
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,520
And do the actual share force by sending
it to that server.

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,352
Now this seems like a very benign thing,
but as we'll show in

49
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:19,656
a second here, this actually opens up

50
00:03:19,656 --> 00:03:22,760
a security hole in Android's permissions
model.

51
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,390
Now, let's look at our second service that
we're going to add.

52
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,944
So, let's say, for example, that we decide
that we want to be able to attach

53
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:34,890
photos to these stories in iRemember, but
attach

54
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,280
photos that aren't necessarily locally
stored in the device.

55
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,228
So, we want the user to be able to type in
a URL of a photo to share, maybe it's a

56
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:50,600
photo that's stored on Facebook's servers
or Google Plus' servers or somewhere else.

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,841
So we want to give the ability for a user

58
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:55,951
to specify an arbitrary URL and then we
want to create

59
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:59,424
a service that will automatically go and
fetch that photo

60
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:03,380
from the Internet and download it to the
local desk.

61
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,118
And then return a file descriptor or

62
00:04:06,118 --> 00:04:11,070
URI specifying where that photo was
downloaded to.

63
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,503
But since we're already going in and
creating a capability

64
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:17,935
to allow other apps to share stories and
photos, why don't

65
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:20,819
we go ahead and just expose the service to
download

66
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,620
arbitrary photos from the Internet as an
intent service as well.

67
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,902
So similarly, we'll allow apps to send to
this service an intent, and in that intent

68
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:40,310
we will have the URL of the photo that we
want to go and collect from the Internet.

69
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,957
And so the service will go and access the
Internet, it'll download that file.

70
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:49,046
[BLANK_AUDIO]

71
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:54,132
And then it will return to this original
service the file that was

72
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:59,230
downloaded, or the location of that file
that was downloaded.

73
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,750
Again, this seems like a, a helpful
service to, we can have

74
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,850
our app, the iRemeber app exposed to other
apps on the device.

75
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,030
So that it makes it easier for them to
share photos and stories.

76
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,675
But, in both cases, we'll actually see,
that

77
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:16,928
we're doing something inadvertently,

78
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:19,710
that's breaking Android's permissions
model.

79
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,245
One of the things to remember is that, for
both of these to

80
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:28,819
work, we're going to have to add the uses
permission to iRemember for Internet.

81
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:31,325
Now we've already probably got it there
for

82
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:34,645
the capabilities that we're exposing in
iRemember, but

83
00:05:34,645 --> 00:05:36,947
we have to remember that we have Internet

84
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:39,540
permissions in order for all of this to
work.
