[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,662
One of the things we have to be careful of
when we're

3
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:14,710
building activities and services and
broadcast

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,458
receivers, is that we don't accidentally

5
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:22,289
take the permissions and the capabilities
and the resources that we've been

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,140
given access to and expose those
permissions or capabilities to other apps.

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,248
So how might we go about accidentally
exposing, let's for example say a resource

8
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:38,399
that we were given access to, in this case
the Internet, to another application?

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,447
Well, intents give other applications the
ability to communicate with us.

10
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:47,994
Interprocess communication gives other
applications

11
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:50,338
the ability to communicate with us.

12
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:52,128
So whenever we build services or

13
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:54,650
capabilities that allow other activities
or

14
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,292
other applications to communicate with our
activities, we have to be very careful

15
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:03,606
that the way that those activities behave
doesn't violate the trust that's

16
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:08,210
been placed in those activities in terms
of the permissions they've been given.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,529
So, for example, let's take a look at this
code base here.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,930
We see that we've got a simple download
activity which seems like

19
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,390
a good idea to help other people be able
to download files.

20
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,802
So, we have this download activity that
we're going to expose to

21
00:01:26,802 --> 00:01:31,375
other activities to allow them to send us
an intent, that specifies

22
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:35,627
an address of some resource on the
internet that they would like

23
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:41,040
to download, and then a file where they'd
like that resource saved.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,530
And then that other activity can go and
get access to it.

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,195
So, we'll see that in our onCreate method,
we do the normal things where

26
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:50,934
we set up the content view for

27
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:54,650
this activity, and then we do something
interesting.

28
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,270
We do this performDownload.

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,753
So, immediately upon starting up, our
activity is going

30
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:05,420
to try to download some file from the
internet.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,390
Now clearly, in order for this code to

32
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,570
work, our activity had to be given
internet permission.

33
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,720
Otherwise any, you know, attempt to access
the internet is simply not going to work.

34
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,130
So let's take a look at what we do with
that permission, that capability,

35
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,270
and how we then leak that, or

36
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,290
cause a privilege escalation potentially
from another application.

37
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,129
So in our performDownload method, the very
first thing that we do, is

38
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:39,813
we go and get the intent out, that's
actually been sent to us.

39
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:42,705
And one of the things that we see in that
intent

40
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:46,830
is an address of the file that the caller
would like downloaded.

41
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,787
We then take that intent, and we also
abstract, extract

42
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:56,310
the actual location where the caller would
like that file saved.

43
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,840
And then finally we simply go and download
that file and save it to disk.

44
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,570
Now, can you see the problem with this
code that we've got here?

45
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,639
Do you see the issue that we're creating?

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,990
In order for us to be able to go and
download this file, and

47
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,710
save it to disk, that requires that our
app have a series of permissions.

48
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,410
In particular, the internet permission.

49
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,810
But, other people, other apps can simply
send us an

50
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,220
intent, and we will go and download a file
for them.

51
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,690
And we're placing no restrictions of what
files or, we'll go an get.

52
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,070
So, we'll take anything in the address.

53
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,540
We don't care what's in that address.

54
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,830
And we'll save it to any old place on
disk.

55
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,187
So any place that we can access, and that
another app tells us to save

56
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:55,720
it, we will go and save that resource that
we downloaded from the internet there.

57
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,330
So, another app doesn't actually have to
get the internet permission.

58
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,550
All another app needs to do, is send us an
intent

59
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,120
and we'll go and do the work on that other
app's behalf.

60
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,367
Now if you remember early on in the series
of lectures we talked about

61
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:17,380
this model of apps are people and how apps
can try to manipulate each other.

62
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,363
And we gave it an analogy of convincing
the bank

63
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:23,850
manager to go and rob the bank vault for
you.

64
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,200
And that's essentially what this code is
doing.

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,318
Another app is convincing our code,
because we're naive in the way that

66
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:35,060
we've built this, to go and download some
arbitrary resource from the Internet.

67
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,860
There are no checks that being placed on

68
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,910
what's being downloaded, or what's being
done with it.

69
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,230
So we are essentially, through all of this
code

70
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,439
that we've got here, we are causing a
privilege escalation.

71
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,792
Or a potential privilege escalation.

72
00:04:53,792 --> 00:05:00,975
And that's because anybody can call this
activity and tell it to go get something

73
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:08,384
off the internet, which is something that
should require internet permissions.

74
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:15,340
But, in this case, we already have the
permission, so the caller doesn't need it.

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,250
And that's a problem.

76
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,995
Because that's allowing us to leak access
to a critical

77
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:33,841
resource that we've been given access to,
to another app.

78
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:40,196
And so now all that some malware needs to
do is simply,

79
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:46,412
go and fire off an intent to our
application, we'll

80
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:53,020
go off and actually access the internet
for it.

81
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,015
And then, send it back, and say we're done
downloading it,

82
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:02,831
and then the malware can go and access the
downloaded file.

83
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:08,430
[BLANK_AUDIO]

84
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,970
And get it, and do whatever it needs to do
with it.

85
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,099
So suddenly, the malware doesn't need the

86
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,438
internet permission anymore, because we're
creating a privilege

87
00:06:16,438 --> 00:06:18,911
escalation situation were it can simply
get access

88
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,940
to the resource that it wants through us.
