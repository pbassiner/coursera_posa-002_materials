[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:11,918
Let's look at another way that an open
service,

3
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:15,789
that can be invoked by an intent, might
accidentally

4
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:19,230
leak a capability that an, another app
does not

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,620
currently have permission to access,
through that intent-based service.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,990
So let's assume that we have a service
that allows an app

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,280
to download an arbitrary file by simply
sending our app an intent.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,310
And you tell our app what is the URL of
the file that you want to download.

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,557
Our app will automatically go and download
that file, store it to disk, and then

10
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:49,488
return via intent to whatever app called
us,

11
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:52,440
the location of the file that we
downloaded.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,266
So we're creating a generic download
service that we want

13
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:59,630
to expose to other apps on the device via
an intent.

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,900
Well, let's say that you're malware and
you

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,850
want to download a malicious payload to
the device.

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,440
So, for example, you want to download some
extra

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,030
code that's going to be used to attack the
device.

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,164
Well, if you're malware and you have no
permissions, you

19
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:17,680
look a less, a lot less suspicious to the
user.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,650
So you can have no permissions.

21
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,084
And essentially the user is going to
think, well it's unlikely this

22
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:27,890
app is going to do anything very
malicious, because it has no permissions.

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,418
But in reality, because you've created
this app that

24
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:35,490
allows another app to send an intent, to
download something.

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,288
So we're going to send an intent,

26
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:43,360
and we're going to say download, attack
payload.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,919
So we'll go and tell it, this malicious
payload that we want

28
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:54,151
to get downloaded, it'll go off to the
internet, and,

29
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:59,390
get that payload for us, and return the
attack payload.

30
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,069
[BLANK_AUDIO]

31
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:12,633
And then it will return to this piece of
malware in its on, result.

32
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:17,051
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:24,486
The file where the attack payload is
stored.

34
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:30,883
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:34,495
So in this case, what we've got, is we've
got an app that's

36
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:39,090
creating a service that's intended to be
helpful to other apps in the device.

37
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,103
But, because it allows any app to send in
an intent saying,

38
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:48,653
go and download something for me and then
it blindly goes and accesses

39
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:53,281
the internet which is a capability that it
has, downloads the payload

40
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:58,080
for it and then returns the payload to
whoever sent it that intent.

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,655
Again, we're bypassing Android's built-in
permissions mechanism by having

42
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:06,566
a piece of malware that's essentially
manipulating another app into

43
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:09,547
getting access to a capability on the
device, in this

44
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:14,210
case, access to the Internet, that it
doesn't currently have.

45
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,451
So one of the things that you have to be
cognizant of, is that, although

46
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:22,482
you can create apps that can talk to other
apps, that when you talk to

47
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:26,300
those other apps that you talk to them in
a way and take commands or

48
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,068
other things from them in a way

49
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:32,000
that doesn't break the permission model on
Android.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,264
That if you're going to use something like
internet an, or the camera, that you make

51
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:39,552
sure that the way that you're using and

52
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,741
accessing that thing and the data you're
returning to

53
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:47,729
the dev, to the application that's asking
for access to it, isn't done in such a way

54
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,611
that, you're breaking the permissions or
circumventing, what

55
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,850
the user intended that app to have access
to.

56
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,720
If the user didn't give a piece of malware

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,100
any permissions, your app shouldn't be
exposing additional capabilities

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,140
or permissions to that malware by not
checking the

59
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,630
capabilities that it has when it begins
interacting with it.
