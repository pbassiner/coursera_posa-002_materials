2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,152
Now a lot of you are probably saying to
yourselves,

3
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:15,710
I would never make such obvious mistakes
in my code.

4
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,690
I would never go and take a user's
password.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,580
And store it to the external storage on an
Android device.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,690
And probably most of you wouldn't if the
code was just that simple.

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,736
But in the real world, most of the code
bases that we work

8
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:37,310
with are a lot more sophisticated than the
ones that we've been looking at.

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,280
The examples that we've seen so far of
leaking private data are purposely

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,690
simplified code examples that help us to
illustrate the specific properties

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,490
that cause code to leak data on the
external storage, or by

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,600
having the wrong permissions, or by
inserting developer data inside of it.

13
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,784
But, in the real code basis that we work
with they're much more

14
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:04,736
sophisticated, and so it's not quite as

15
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:06,990
straightforward to see these types of
errors.

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,250
So what we're going to look at now is what
makes it hard to write

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,420
applications that don't necessarily adhere
to all

18
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,180
of the security practices we've just
talked about.

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,100
And the approaches that we can use to help
improve how we

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,530
write our code so that it's much more
obvious when we're making

21
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,214
mistakes, and much easier to ensure that
we don't make mistakes and

22
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:33,930
that other developers don't make mistakes
in how they use our code.

23
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,433
The key thing that we're going to see is
that when we

24
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:44,619
write apps, we typically don't write a
simple app, but we

25
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:49,910
write an app that's built on a series of
abstractions, that

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:55,130
get ever more, high level as we go up the
stack.

27
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:01,067
And our app is built on top of these
abstractions, and if we're not

28
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:07,216
careful about how we build these
abstractions and how we use them, we

29
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:13,683
will end up in situations where it's very
hard to see how an action appear

30
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:19,860
causes leakage of data out the bottom end
of the set of abstractions.

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,280
And so what the goal, of, these, tips that
we're going to talk about in a

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,510
minute, are, is to ensure that when we

33
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,690
build abstractions into our code, that we
don't

34
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,850
build abstractions that make it hard to do

35
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,840
the right thing, but instead we build
abstractions

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,360
and interfaces that make it easy for
developers

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
to do the right thing with our code.

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,780
And make it easy for developers to see
that code

39
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,650
written with our abstractions are doing
things properly and securely.
