1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,900
Welcome to the next part of the class.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,120
In this module, we're going to be
providing more information on patterns and

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,260
frameworks, to extend and augment material
that we'll be covering in this course.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,033
If we went back 20 years ago or so and
taught this

5
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:24,980
class, we find that there was much less
material back in those days.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,845
There were some early papers on patterns.

7
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:30,907
Peter Coad had published a paper in 1992.

8
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,987
Ralph Johnson had published a paper about

9
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:38,387
documenting frameworks with patterns in
1992, and of

10
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:41,907
course, the gang of four published their
first

11
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:45,810
collected paper on patterns in ECOOP in
1993.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,260
Work on frameworks goes back a little
further.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,972
If you went back about 25 years ago or so,
you'd see that there were

14
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,340
some papers by Ralph Johnson and Brian
Foote

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,550
talking about frameworks from the 1988
time frame.

16
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,630
And there was a lot of classic work done

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,685
by Taligent, which were some of the early
promoters and

18
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:09,065
evangelists for frameworks, talking about
the work they had

19
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:13,770
done developing frameworks for building
operating systems and user interfaces.

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,640
This module provides a tour through some
of the landscape

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,399
of literature that has appeared over the
past two decades.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,850
Of course, the classic works in the field
we've covered in

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,370
depth, the Gang of Four book, and the POSA
One book.

24
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,260
There are also four other volumes of the
POSA series.

25
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,730
The Pattern Oriented Software Architecture
series.

26
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,030
And these books talk about many other
dimensions.

27
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,450
Many of which have a lot to do with
concurrent and network software.

28
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,134
For example, the POSA 2 book, which I was
the first

29
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:51,310
author on, talks about a patterned
language for concurrent network software.

30
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,260
And we will be talking about many of these
patterns throughout the course.

31
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,780
There's also a book called POSA 3, which

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,179
deals with a pattern language for resource
management.

33
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,370
Patterns for dealing with resources,
allocating

34
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,408
resources, deallocating resources, and so
on.

35
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:11,368
POSA 4 combines over a hundred patterns to

36
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:16,690
focus on a pattern language for
distributed computing.

37
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,330
And what makes this particularly
interesting is that the real

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,690
emphasis of the book is not on the
individual patterns and

39
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,770
isolation, which to some extent is the
focus of POSA

40
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,380
1, POSA 2 and POSA 3, and again, a four
book.

41
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,090
But, it really focuses more on the way in
which those patterns work together.

42
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,030
So, well over half the book is talking
about interactions

43
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,820
between patterns as opposed to talking
about the patterns by themselves.

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,345
POSA 5 provides a tour through the concept
space and the foundational themes

45
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:54,160
and ideas and abstractions underlying
patterns and pattern languages.

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,995
And it talks about relationships between
patterns, pattern complements,

47
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:01,949
pattern compounds, pattern sequences and,
of course, pattern languages.

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,634
They are other books that are very
important to get an architectural

49
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:10,478
view of patterns, and even though the
books don't have the words pattern

50
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:13,516
in the title, they still deal with many of
the same kinds of

51
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:18,248
abstractions that we've seen in other
books in the pattern body of work.

52
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:21,704
One of the best examples of this
particular type of book is

53
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:24,800
the book Software Architecture,
perspectives on

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,670
an Emerging Discipline, by Shaw and
Garlan.

55
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,210
And they talk about many of the
fundamental patterns

56
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:36,010
and architectural styles that exist in
build large-scale software systems.

57
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,606
There are also a number of other books
that talk about

58
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:41,785
various aspect of patterns that are worth
taking a look at.

59
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:45,670
The late John Vissides wrote an excellent
book called Pattern Hatching.

60
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,350
Which grew out of some columns he'd
written for

61
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,050
the C++ report magazine, while I was the
editor.

62
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,698
And many of these patterns either were
patterns that didn't make it

63
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:58,962
into the Gang of Four book because they
were incomplete at the

64
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:03,122
time, but he completed, or there are
additional patterns that he described

65
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:08,070
based on his experience applying the Gang
of Four Patterns in different contexts.

66
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,086
For example, the discussion about
destroying singletons was something that

67
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,370
came out after he wrote the Gang of Four
Patterns.

68
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,148
There's also a number of patterns

69
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:21,662
and other domains pertaining distributive
computing.

70
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:27,268
And Middleware is book on patterns for
programming J2EE.

71
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,090
There's patterns for enterprise
integration.

72
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,270
There's even patterns about component
middleware and patterns for

73
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,740
brokers and patterns for remoting that are
worth looking at.

74
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,610
There's also patterns for how to program
parallel and distributed systems.

75
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,290
Trying to take advantage of multi-core and
multi-processor hardware, effectively.

76
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,670
The pattern is that we're trying to build
systems that

77
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,060
will be resilient in the face of failures
and attacks.

78
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,630
And there's also patterns that deal with
how to write code that will be secure.

79
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,662
That will be able to operate, even when
you have adversaries that will try to

80
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:04,640
break in to your system and attack your
network, steal your data and so on.

81
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,510
One of the things that happened when I
first

82
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,660
got involved with patterns in the 1994
time frame

83
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,530
was we had a series of conferences called
pattern

84
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,800
languages of programming, and these
conferences would bring together

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,810
both experts and novices for several days
at Alcuin

86
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,750
Park in Illinois, where we would sit
together and

87
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,850
work on how to improve the way we were

88
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,260
documenting our designs and our
architectures and our software structures.

89
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,960
And from these conferences came a series
of books that collected

90
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,230
together, revised, and it edited versions
of the papers from these conferences.

91
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,160
That are now known as the Program Pattern
Languages of Program Design, PLoP D books.

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,980
And there are five of these in all.

93
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,646
And they give kind of a nice, kind of,
broad view of

94
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:56,030
the thinking of the pattern community from
1994 to about 2000 time frame.

95
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,362
There are some excellent books for people
who are trying to

96
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:04,250
build software that have to run in unusual
or constrained environments.

97
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,045
So-called small memory software, which is
often

98
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:09,385
the case for embedded systems which don't

99
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:11,400
have the luxury of gigabytes worth of

100
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,440
memory or high speed processors or
unlimited power.

101
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,368
And of course, one of the other classic
books in the field

102
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:22,760
of concurrency for patterns is Doug Lea's
book for concurrent programming in Java,

103
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,993
which talks about many of the different
ways of trying to devise

104
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:30,070
Java concurrent programs and many of the
patterns for effective use of Java.

105
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,266
You'll find that many of the ideas that
are

106
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,316
documented as patterns in Doug Lea's book
have found their

107
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:38,122
way into the Java class libraries for
concurrency, as

108
00:06:38,122 --> 00:06:41,370
well as into frameworks we've talked about
such as Android.

109
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,909
If you take a look at the Hillside
website, which is

110
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:48,036
dedicated to all things patterns, you'll
find a more extensive list

111
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:50,792
of many of the books related to the
patterns, the community,

112
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:54,290
and, and work on patterns, and the body of
knowledge of patterns.

113
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,516
There are also a number of books on
frameworks.

114
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:01,820
One of the early contributions of
frameworks as I mentioned before

115
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,124
was from the Taligent Group, which was a
company that was building

116
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:09,136
frameworks to try to encapsulate low level
operating system details and provide

117
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:13,960
a higher level programming abstractions to
make it easier to build applications.

118
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,836
And there's a book called Inside Taligent,
by Cotter and Patel, that has a nice

119
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:20,629
chapter that describes the philosophy of
frameworks that

120
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:22,900
came with the approach that they were
doing.

121
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,438
There's also a series of books that were
published with

122
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:32,396
some colleagues of mine, relating to
building patterns and applying patterns

123
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:36,392
in the form of frameworks, having
frameworks applied in domain

124
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:40,680
specific ways, frameworks applied in more
generic ways and so on.

125
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,950
And you might want to take a look.

126
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,358
These are collections of papers from
people who had

127
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:47,780
experience either building or trying to
apply frameworks in practice.

128
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,575
Speaking of applying patterns and
frameworks in

129
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:53,915
practice, along the way over the past 20

130
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,865
years or so, I've also developed a

131
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:59,860
large number of frameworks, heavily driven
by patterns.

132
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,036
Many of those patterns were documented in
the POSA 2 book, but I've also published a

133
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:06,356
series of books that talk about the
application

134
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:09,090
of these patterns in the ACE framework
environment.

135
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,580
And so you might want to take a look at
some

136
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,090
of the books that describe the frameworks
that are used in ACE.

137
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,529
I mentioned before the pattern languages
of

138
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:21,160
programming conference, PLoP, which
started in 1994.

139
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,794
It's been ongoing for years, and, in fact,
it is now

140
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:28,823
generalized and grown beyond its initial
focus in the US, at

141
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:33,405
Alcuin Park to be an international
sequence of conferences that take

142
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:39,440
place in Germany, South America,
Scandinavia and other parts of the world.

143
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,138
The main benefit of going to a PLoP
conference

144
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:44,836
is it gives a chance for pattern authors
to get

145
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:48,244
feedback on the patterns that they're
writing down from

146
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:53,050
experts, in the form of something called a
writer's workshop.

147
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,650
A writer's workshop is a format derived
from the

148
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,900
poetry and writing community where you
have people sit around

149
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,840
in a circle, listen carefully to a
description of

150
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,140
the, of the pattern or the work that's
being discussed.

151
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,390
And then they take turns providing
feedback to the author, things that

152
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,260
worked, things that didn't work, things
they liked, things that could be improved.

153
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,972
And it could provides invaluable feedback
to people who are trying to

154
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:22,490
codify their design expertise and write it
down and disseminate in pattern form.

155
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,460
There's also a series of information about
pattern

156
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,460
conferences that's also found on the
Hillside website.

157
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,140
There's also a set of mailing lists if
you'd like to learn more about patterns.

158
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,444
There's mailing lists that talk about the

159
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:38,940
Gang of Four Patterns, the various
Siemens'

160
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,780
POSA patterns, patterns for interprocess
communication, patterns

161
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,960
for business and other types of topics.

162
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,600
If you take a look at the Hillside
website, you'll find a

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,690

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,526
And, finally, I have also produced quite
an amount of information over the

165
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:58,803
years that I make available on patterns

166
00:09:58,803 --> 00:10:02,440
and frameworks through my website at
Vanderbilt.

167
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,120
I have some information here that talks

168
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,880
about the books I've written, on patterns
and

169
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,430
frameworks, the presentations that I've
recorded in either

170
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,880
podcast or video form on patterns and
frameworks.

171
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,420
I've also taught many courses on patterns
and frameworks,

172
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,200
at the various universities I've been a
faculty member of.

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,900
All that material, the slides, the
assignment descriptions, and

174
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,910
the syllabi and so on, are all available
online.

175
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,326
And of course, I've not just talked about
patterns and frameworks; I've

176
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:37,742
also built, and helped build, millions of
lines of code, largely written

177
00:10:37,742 --> 00:10:41,882
in C++, some written in Java, that
implement many of these patterns

178
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:46,630
in frameworks that you can download and
apply and use in your projects.

179
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,660
So take a look at my website, explore the
links, and feel free to use

180
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,130
this material in a way that you see fit to
make your projects more effective.
