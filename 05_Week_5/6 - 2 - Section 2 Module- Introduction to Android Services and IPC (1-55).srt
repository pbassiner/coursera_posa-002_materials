00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:12,419
Welcome to the first module in the section
on Android Services and Security.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,064
This module examines several types of
frameworks and mechanisms provided

4
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:18,874
by Android, that allow applications

5
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:21,850
to perform computations in service
components.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,548
Which can execute long duration operations
in background threads or processes, and

7
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:27,655
potentially communicate with other
activity or

8
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:29,880
service components throughout their life
cycle.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,946
It also examines several types of

10
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:36,138
inner process communication mechanisms
that Android provides,

11
00:00:36,138 --> 00:00:38,361
to enable activity components and
background

12
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:41,450
service components, to interact
concurrently and securely.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,310
We discussed started services, which
typically

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,830
perform a single operation before
terminating,

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,930
and bound services, which allow clients

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,290
to conduct longer conversations with
service implementations.

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,746
Activities and services interact via
several inter-process

18
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:00,554
communication mechanisms that are
optimized for passing

19
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:03,303
messages between processes on Android
mobile devices,

20
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:06,640
via the binder object-oriented remote
procedure call framework.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,237
This module examines several Android
inter-process

22
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,360
communication mechanisms that use the
binder.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,139
Including intents, which are commands
passed to

24
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:17,587
an activity or service when it's started,

25
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:20,167
and messengers which extend the intra
process

26
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:24,100
message passing mechanisms in the Android
hammer framework.

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,790
To enable interprocess message passing
communication.

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,386
We also cover the Android interface
definition language that's often used to

29
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:34,406
simply Java application access to the

30
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:37,890
powerful, but complex, binder
communication capabilities.

31
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,083
Naturally, the Android services and
interprocess communication mechanisms

32
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,620
apply many posa and gang of four patterns.

33
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,636
Which we also cover throughout the module.
