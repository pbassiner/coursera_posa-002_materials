1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:08,720
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,586
Now if all of our apps, were, wrapped up
and protected

3
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:18,030
by Android, to where they could never
interact and exchange data.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,291
If they could never read each other's
saved state,

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:25,750
ever, we'd have much less interesting
applications on our devices.

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,790
Almost all of the really interesting
Android applications involve some type of

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,725
interaction between that app and another
app or set of services on the device.

8
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:43,300
Or with the data that they're storing
underneath their apps.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,960
So for example, the Contacts app.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,669
The Contacts app that's on Android by
default, stores its data and persists it.

11
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:55,380
And Android protects that save state of
your contacts.

12
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,233
But at the same time we want to be able to

13
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:01,110
get access to the contact list sometimes
from other apps.

14
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,439
So Android does provide mechanisms to
allow apps to share

15
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:12,590
data outside of the protected sandboxes
that Android provides for them.

16
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,957
So apps can both, share data outside of

17
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:17,756
the processes that they're running in, so
at

18
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:20,268
run time they can share data that they've

19
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:23,027
loaded and is running outside to other
apps.

20
00:01:23,027 --> 00:01:26,652
And the Android apps can also, if they
want to, share

21
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:30,610
data that they persisted in the file
system to other apps.

22
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,889
Now, by default Android tries to protect
you.

23
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:39,359
It tries to keep your app within its own
little sandbox with its own

24
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,528
process, protecting the memory of that
app,

25
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:45,630
protecting the data its storing on the
disk.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,054
But, it gives you the option to build

27
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:52,300
richer apps that do talk outside of their
sandbox.

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,958
But it's in these interactions where we
begin talking to

29
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:01,062
other apps and services on the device,
when we begin persisting

30
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:04,178
data in ways that other apps can read and
interact

31
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:07,830
with, that we run the danger of writing an
insecure app.

32
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:15,150
So, the two big areas that we have to be
careful of are, one,

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,710
that run time when we begin interacting
with and talking with other apps.

34
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,320
And typically the way that you do this on

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,540
Android is through, as you've seen,
inter-process communication, or IPC.

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,628
And IPC can take a number of forms, as
we've seen.

37
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:39,750
This can be the exchange of intents
between applications and services.

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,749
This can be binding, interacting with a
service, and

39
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:51,190
invoking a service that's running in
another app or process.

40
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,971
So, something like getting access to the
GPS.

41
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:58,040
That's not going to be running in your
apps process.

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,239
So all of these interactions through IPC,
whenever we decide to have those

43
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,620
interactions, we need to be cognizant that
we're exposing our app to another app.

44
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,120
We're opening up the sandbox that we live
in by default, and we're allowing our app

45
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,470
to interact with the memory of other apps,

46
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,610
and to interact with the memory of our
app.

47
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,934
So, whenever we begin doing interactions
through

48
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:30,417
intents, through services, or through
other mechanisms, we're

49
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:36,400
beginning to open up our app at run time
and open up those memory protections.

50
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,054
The other thing that we can do, is we can

51
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:43,000
save data to sort of communal areas on the
disc.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,530
So we can do things like save data to the
SD card.

53
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,230
And in many cases, you want to save things
to the SD card.

54
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,749
So for example, if you have a custom
camera app

55
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:56,366
that you're writing, you probably want to
store those pictures on

56
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,562
the SD card so that the user can remove
the

57
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:01,780
SD card, put a new one in to store more
pictures.

58
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,006
And also so that other applications like

59
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:07,890
the Photo Gallery application can read
those photos.

60
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,480
So there are certain places, like the SD
card, when we store

61
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,810
data that we're opening our apps persisted
state up to other apps.

62
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,750
You can also store data with different
permissions.

63
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,271
So we can change the default permissions
when we store data.

64
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:29,929
Even they we're storing it in our apps'

65
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:32,822
own a little private data storage area on
the

66
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:35,557
device, we can still open up that data and

67
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:38,626
store it with things like, read from any
app.

68
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:40,650
And we can change those permissions.

69
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,694
So whenever we do those type of things, or
we store data in a

70
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:48,736
way that other apps can get access to it,
we have to be aware

71
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:54,266
of the possibility of another app coming
and either reading that information in

72
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:59,657
order to corrupt it, or to use that
information to attack our app in some way.

73
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:01,795
Or to trick it in some way.

74
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:05,114
The other area the Android can't protect
us

75
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:09,770
again, is if we have a graphical user
interface.

76
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,790
So we have a GUI that is a part of our
app.

77
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,590
Now, GUIs are great.

78
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,999
We can use a GUI to get information from

79
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:21,699
the user that we need, like their username
and password.

80
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,000
But GUIs are also areas where other apps
can try to attack our app.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,790
Because a GUI is way of inputting data
into our app.

82
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,129
So although we have a process that's

83
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:37,147
protecting the memory around our app, any
type

84
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:42,470
of GUI is an area where we're allowing
data to be placed into our process.

85
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,273
Either through fields like username and
password that the user

86
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:51,451
is going to provide data, or by going in
adding buttons.

87
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:56,756
Which when they're clicked, they turn into
events that are injected into

88
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:02,900
the memory of our application and give
another app the chance to attack us.

89
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,760
Now, a GUI, another piece of

90
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,800
malware probably can't directly manipulate
your GUI.

91
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,810
But what it can do is, it can trick the

92
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,310
user into manipulating your GUI into a
state that it wants.

93
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,550
So it can trick the user and make it

94
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,003
think that it's doing something other than
it is.

95
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:29,210
So, it manipulates the user to convince
them that, it's logging into your

96
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,670
banking app when in reality it's providing
a fake GUI to do something else.

97
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,000
So the GUI is another area that we have to
protect.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,814
We either have to protect it from taking
data that's

99
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:44,985
going into our memory and corrupting it in
some way.

100
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:49,302
Or getting knowledge of that data in some
way, such as user name and password.

101
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:52,211
Or, protect it from taking a GUI that's
supposed

102
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,635
to be putting data into our process and
our

103
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:58,656
memory space where it's protected, and
instead, extracting that

104
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:01,239
data and putting it into a piece of
malware.

105
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,378
So these are three really important areas
that we have to understand

106
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:10,403
what Android protects us against and what
it doesn't protect us against.

107
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:15,210
And what we as developers have to do to
make sure that we write more secure apps.

108
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,400
We want to make sure we protect our GUIs.

109
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,703
We want to make sure we protect the things
that

110
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:22,350
we store, in terms of state on the disk.

111
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,492
And we want to make sure that we protect
our

112
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:26,508
interactions with other apps through

113
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:29,410
inter-process communication or other
mechanisms.
