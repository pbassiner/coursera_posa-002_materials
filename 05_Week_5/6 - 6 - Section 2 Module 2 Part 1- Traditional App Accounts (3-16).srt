[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:11,331
So, one of the important things to
understand, when

3
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:16,650
building Android applications, is how to
write secure Android applications.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,682
We've all seen stories in the news about
apps that didn't properly secure their

5
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:24,198
user's data, and allowed other apps to

6
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:27,462
read and write their private messages or
contacts.

7
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:32,632
And so what this series of lectures is
going to cover is, what are sort of the

8
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:37,907
basic things that you need to understand
about how Android security works?

9
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:42,953
And then based on your understanding of
what Android provides you from a

10
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:48,352
security perspective, how you can write
your app to improve its security.

11
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:51,629
So one of the first things to understand,
when

12
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,418
we're talking about Android security, is
how Android's version

13
00:00:56,418 --> 00:01:00,535
of how applications, or apps operate, is
different than

14
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:05,258
from what we see on a traditional desktop
computing environment.

15
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:08,389
So in a traditional desktop and computing
environment, if

16
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:11,593
we launch an application, let's say it's a
photo editor.

17
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:17,978
And we'll say this is our first app that
we're launching, so this is app one.

18
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:22,610
And let's say that, that photo editor goes
and we open it and we decide that we

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,677
want to access the internet maybe to
download, send

20
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:29,130
images that we have stored, on Facebook or
Flickr.

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,686
And then after getting those images we go
and we edit

22
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:37,380
the images, and we save them to a storage
on the disk.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,173
Now one of the important things about

24
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:44,628
the way that desktop environments work, is
that

25
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:47,747
they associate each app that you launch
with

26
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:51,650
a single person, that is your user
account.

27
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,800
If you launch an app, that app is
associated with your user account, and has

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,540
all of the permissions and capabilities
that

29
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,850
are part of whatever's in your user
account.

30
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,320
So, this app will be part of your user
account.

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,420
And when you go and launch a second
application, this is where

32
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,400
this concept of each app running within
your user account becomes important.

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,803
So if we go and we launch a second
application, let's say that this is your

34
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:26,004
browser and you're going to view in a

35
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:29,700
web browser, exactly what that image looks
like.

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,120
So we'll launch our web browser.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,380
This is our sec, second application.

38
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,080
One of the important things is, is that

39
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,300
this will also be running in our user
account.

40
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,774
And what that means is, is that this
application can go and directly

41
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:53,071
access those same areas of storage that
the first app can access.

42
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:56,502
And the reason is, that the privileges and
permissions

43
00:02:56,502 --> 00:03:00,006
that are governing the web browser, which
is another app

44
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:03,145
that I, the user, have launched, are
exactly the

45
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:07,370
same as the privileges and permissions of
the first app.

46
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,314
And that's because I as the user launched
both of these

47
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:14,670
applications, and therefore both of them
are associated with my user account.
