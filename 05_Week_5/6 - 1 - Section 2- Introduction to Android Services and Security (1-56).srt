00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:12,686
Welcome to the section on Android Services
and applications security.

3
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:15,336
Which explores the pattern oriented
frameworks and

4
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:18,469
mechanisms that Android provides, to
perform computations

5
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,878
in the background and communicate between
user

6
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:25,050
phasing components and background
components, concurrently, and securely.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,383
Although the activity components, covered
in Professor Porter's Mooc,

8
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:33,230
provide a flexible visual interface for
interacting with the user.

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,583
Android also defines service components,
which run in the separate

10
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:40,360
background thread or process, and don't
interact with the user directly.

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,960
Instead, activities use services to
perform long duration

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,980
operations or access remote resources on
behalf of users.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,990
Such as downloading files from a remote
server.

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,660
Or synchronizing data stored on a mobile
device, with a database in the cloud.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,789
Activities and services can interact via
several interprocess

16
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,700
communication mechanisms, that we'll cover
in this section.

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,093
This section also focuses on Android

18
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,619
application security, which is an
important and

19
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:10,483
timely topic, due to the increasing

20
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:13,990
number of Android application
vulnerabilities being discovered.

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,347
We first describe Android security model
and

22
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:19,590
explain some of its risks and limitations.

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,870
We then discuss various techniques, tools
and

24
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,000
methods for building more secure Android
applications.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,834
We explain the most common types of

26
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:30,554
security flaws in Android applications,
show how

27
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:34,680
to spot them in code, and describe methods
and means for fixing these flaws.

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,528
This section also explains how to design
and implement services, activities and

29
00:01:40,528 --> 00:01:42,784
other Android components to protect your

30
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:45,634
applications against security flaws and
attacks.
