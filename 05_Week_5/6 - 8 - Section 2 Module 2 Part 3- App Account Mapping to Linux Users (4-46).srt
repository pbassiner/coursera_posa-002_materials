[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:12,511
When your app gets installed, that's when
the system creates the

3
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:17,180
identity of the account that's going to be
associated with your app.

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,091
So let's dive a little deeper into what
that actually

5
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:23,360
means an app for Android when you install
an app.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,080
And what happens under the hood to create
that user account.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,157
Well, when you create an Android app, one
of the things

8
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:37,165
you have to specify is an Android manifest
that XML file.

9
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:39,991
And this is a file, that all of you should

10
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,660
be very well familiar with if you've been
building Android apps.

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,349
And what this does is it tells Android

12
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:50,385
things that it needs to know about your
app

13
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,073
in order to install it on the system,

14
00:00:53,073 --> 00:00:57,606
in order to understand what it's different
components are.

15
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:02,073
And very importantly from a security
perspective, it tells it

16
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:06,962
which capabilities of the hardware
platform on the Android device,

17
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:11,429
or the capabilities provided by other
apps, like the Contacts

18
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:14,820
app, that you want to have access to in
your app.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,770
So you declare a series of uses
permissions.

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,280
And these are things that your app wants

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,690
to have access to on the underlying
platform.

22
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,860
And each of these user permissions
corresponds to

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,320
some type of underlying capability of the
device.

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,180
Something like access to the internet,
maybe.

25
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,530
Or, access to the camera.

26
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,985
And your app declares all of these things
up front, so that when the user

27
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:54,251
installs your app on their device, Android
can go and scan all of these

28
00:01:54,251 --> 00:02:00,142
user permissions, figure out what they map
to in terms of capabilities on your

29
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:05,706
device, and then present a menu to the
user, saying do you want to allow?

30
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:09,800
[BLANK_AUDIO]

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,097
This app to have access to X, Y, and Z
things?

32
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:19,754
So the user gets to decide, is this okay?

33
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:22,407
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:27,889
And if they say that it's okay, what
Android does, is it takes all of these

35
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:33,113
user permissions, and it goes and creates
an account on the underlying

36
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:38,590
Linux operation system, that's part of
Android, for your app.

37
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,080
So Android, is a modified version of Linux
that runs on mobile devices.

38
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,418
And when you create that install an app
and then create a user account for it,

39
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:54,313
what's actually happening is that the
underlying Linux

40
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:57,746
operating system is creating a user for
that app.

41
00:02:57,746 --> 00:03:03,326
So this and this basically create

42
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:08,640
the Linux user, for your app.

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,520
This is what's define the capabilities of
this Linux user.

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,350
Is the things that you ask for in your
manifest file?

45
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:23,770
Underneath the hood, each of the things
you ask for like internet, or camera.

46
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,100
Each of those has a separate Linux group
that's associated with it.

47
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,720
For example, you may have the camera
group.

48
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,020
And this is a user group, that is set up
to

49
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,520
define the set of users that have access
to the camera.

50
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,630
And this is already on the device, when
you install the app.

51
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,790
And so what Android does is it creates
your Linux user.

52
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,496
And then based on each of the user permit,
user's permissions, it figures

53
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:59,190
out which of the different user groups
your accounts should be associated with.

54
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,622
So it associates, this, app, for a photo
editor, let's say, with it's own Linux

55
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:10,470
user, and then it associates that Linux
user with the underlying camera group.

56
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,800
And so now, when your app is running, if
your app goes and tries to

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,440
access the camera, Android and its
underlying Linux kernel can look

58
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,220
at the user account associated with your
app, and then can check if

59
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,150
it's part of this Linux user group that
should have access to the camera.

60
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,520
So underneath the hood, all of these
permissions

61
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,920
that we see in our apps, and that are

62
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,050
manifested as uses permissions in the
Android manifest XML

63
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,070
files, actually get mapped down to Linux
user groups.
