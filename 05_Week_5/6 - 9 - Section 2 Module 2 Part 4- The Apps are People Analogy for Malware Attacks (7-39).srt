2
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:12,198
Let's talk more in depth about this
analogy that apps

3
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:17,250
are people, and understand what that means
from a security perspective.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,700
The first thing we can think about is,
what are the attacks?

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,610
If we assume that, that apps are people,
and

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,920
that's the analogy we're going to use for
security,

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,140
what are the attacks, or things that
people do

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,020
maliciously against each other, that we
want to protect against?

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,972
Well, the first thing that an app can do,
and maybe it's

10
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:45,300
common that people do unfortunately, is
they can lie to each other.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,140
So, they can provide false information to
each other.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,946
So, one app that's interacting with
another app or talking to it through

13
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:59,150
a IPC or intents, can lie and tell it
something that's not true.

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,790
So, as an app developer, we have to be
very concerned about checking

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,520
data or input validation of the things
that other apps are telling us.

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,455
Another thing that malware can do, since
it's a person

17
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:17,090
interacting with our app, is it can steal
from our app.

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,340
So, it can try to access information,
which is really the currency of apps.

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,360
It can try to access that information that

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,230
this app doesn't want exposed to the other
app.

21
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,380
And that information could help it to do
something malicious directly to this app.

22
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,270
Or it might be the information that that

23
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,280
app needs in order to attack somebody
else.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,840
For example, to steal contacts from your
app so

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,970
that it can spam them and try to convince

26
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,280
them to install the app and also be
infected

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,580
so they can try to steal from each other.

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,880
Another thing that apps can do, which is
also sort of

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,780
a form of lying, but they can try to
manipulate each other.

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,258
By either lying, or more interestingly,
going and telling one of that app's

31
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:14,824
friends something that it would like that
app to know in order to manipulate it.

32
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:20,430
Because this app may trust another app,
more than it trusts the malware.

33
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,058
So, this malware doesn't necessarily have
to directly manipulate your app, it

34
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:29,967
may use another intermediary to manipulate
your app, another app that yours trusts.

35
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:33,522
So, you have to be concerned not only
about your own security,

36
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:36,960
but the security of the other apps that
you talk to and trust.

37
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,054
And, it can also go and manipulate the
user that's using

38
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:46,340
your app, by showing them a false GUI or
false information.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,190
And trying to convince them to do
something to your app that, if

40
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,000
the user does it, you'll accept it but
another app couldn't necessarily do it.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,131
So these are some interesting things, if
we use this

42
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:01,700
analogy of apps are people that we want to
protect against.

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,390
We don't want other apps to lie to us or
steal from us or manipulate from us.

44
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:11,737
Another thing we don't want to do, is we
don't want to have our app inadvertently

45
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:15,070
manipulated by another app into doing
something on

46
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,490
that other apps behalf that isn't a good
thing.

47
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:24,140
So, for example, if you told me to rob a
bank, hopefully I won't do it.

48
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,949
But if another app tells your app to go

49
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:32,430
and access the Internet, it's a similar
type of situation.

50
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,330
Maybe that original app doesn't have
access to the Internet.

51
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,530
It really wants access to the Internet and
it knows that your app does.

52
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,510
So maybe your app is the equivalent of the
bank manager that has access to the vault.

53
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,459
So if that malware, rather than directly
accessing the

54
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,093
vault, which it doesn't have access to,
can get

55
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:52,602
your app, which is the bank manager, to
access

56
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:55,990
that vault and give that information back
to the malware.

57
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,710
That's also just as good as getting access
to it itself.

58
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,910
So we have to protect our apps from being
manipulated by other apps through lying

59
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,050
or stealing or other means, in order to do
things bad on behalf of another app.

60
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:16,470
And we'll talk about specific types of
attacks that fall into this model of

61
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,840
lying and stealing and manipulation that
malware uses to attack good apps.
