2
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:13,565
Let's contrast the way the Android works
from security perspective,

3
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:18,310
from the way that a traditional desktop
operating system works.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,610
So what is fundamentally different?

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,784
Well, if you have to sum it up in

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,650
one phrase, it's that apps are people, on
Android.

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,780
And this is a really profound thing from a
security point of view that

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,850
makes Android behave from a security
perspective

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,750
very differently from a traditional
desktop environment.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,689
So let's take a look at how this affects
things.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,883
On Android, if I go and launch an app, and
let's

12
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:47,244
say it's, you know, it, we, we take a
photograph with

13
00:00:47,244 --> 00:00:50,046
the camera, and we touch it up in a photo
editing

14
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:54,134
program, similar to what we were doing in
our desktop user example.

15
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:58,380
So, we launch our first app, which is a
photo editor, to touch up a photo.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,216
And this is going to be our first app,

17
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:08,750
and it's going to access information on
the device.

18
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,020
Now, one of the immediate things that's
different is that this

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,300
app is going to be launched with its own
user account.

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,892
So the photo editor is going to have a
photo editor user.

21
00:01:22,892 --> 00:01:29,050
It's a separate account that's associated
with it.

22
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,465
And what this means it that the photo
editor

23
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:34,283
has its own set of privileges and
permissions that

24
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:37,167
have been assigned to it, that aren't the
default

25
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,850
ones that are assigned to me as a user.

26
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,690
Because, even though I've launched that
app,

27
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,790
because I've launched it, under my user

28
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,960
account doesn't mean that, that photo
editor

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,250
automatically gets all of my permissions
and capabilities.

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,364
We want to restrict what that photo editor
is able to do, to

31
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,030
only things that I, as the user, want it
to be able to do.

32
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,344
So it has its own photo editor user
account that has been created when

33
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:07,930
I installed that app, and when I agreed to
let it have certain permissions.

34
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,040
So what this means is the photo editor can
access

35
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,255
parts of the storage that are associated
with the photo editor.

36
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:18,262
So that we can think of our storage as
being divided up.

37
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:23,573
And so there's a region of that storage
that's assigned to that photo editor.

38
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:28,708
And it can read and write files to that
region of the storage that's part of its

39
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:34,790
private data, or the area within the
storage that's been sliced off for it.

40
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,827
Similarly, if when I installed this photo
editor, I gave it permission to access

41
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:45,380
the internet, then its user account has a
special permission associated with it.

42
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,611
It allows it to go and access the internet

43
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:51,230
through the Wi-Fi or cellular network
connected to the device.

44
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,969
Where the model of security that has apps
as people

45
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:00,400
gets really interesting, is when we launch
a second application.

46
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,861
So, let's say on the Android we launch a
second application, which is a web browser

47
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:11,630
that we're going to view our edited image
in just like we did on the desktop.

48
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,233
Now, where there's an immediate difference
in how Android operates,

49
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:21,620
is what this web browser can access on the
storage system.

50
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,459
The web browser, if this was on the
desktop,

51
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,299
would be able to just directly go and read
this

52
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:30,438
file that I had saved in the photo editor,
because

53
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,818
both applications would have been
associated with my user account.

54
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:39,280
And thus they both have access to the same
areas in the storage system.

55
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,733
But, on Android, because this web browser
is going to run

56
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:51,489
underneath its own user account, its web
browser, user, it

57
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:57,374
can't directly access the files created by
the photo editor.

58
00:03:57,374 --> 00:04:02,220
Because, the photo editor stuff is
private, so this is not allowed.

59
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,690
Because this is private access.

60
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,560
This is something that exists only for
this photo editor user account.

61
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:18,467
So one of the immediate differences is,
that each app that I launch as a user does

62
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:24,270
not automatically get the same permissions
and capabilities as other apps.

63
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,078
So I can't just launch a photo editor,
save some data to the

64
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:32,798
storage system of that, in the private
storage of that photo editor, and

65
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:37,826
then access it with the web browser,
because they have separate user accounts

66
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:42,038
and they have access to separate sets of
files on the file system.

67
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,305
Now there are ways to get around this that
we'll talk about.

68
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:50,100
And one of them for example, is saving
images to the SD card on your device.

69
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,574
But, when we begin doing things like
saving data

70
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:57,682
to the SD card, or to other places that
other

71
00:04:57,682 --> 00:05:00,959
apps can access, we have to be conscious
from a

72
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,180
security point of view what the
ramifications are of that.

73
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,633
Now the important thing to remember is, by
default, Android wants each

74
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:17,660
app to be its own user and to save data in
its own private data store system.

75
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,125
By default, Android is segregating your
app from other apps on the system

76
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:27,180
to prevent them from stealing data from
your apps or doing other malicious things.
