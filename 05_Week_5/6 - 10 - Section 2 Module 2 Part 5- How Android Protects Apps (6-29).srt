[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:13,393
So to help improve the security of how we
write apps, let's

3
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:19,050
talk a little bit about how Android
protects our apps from other apps.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,780
And then once we understand how it
protects our

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,860
apps, we can also understand what it
doesn't do for

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,380
us, and what it expects us as developers
to

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,970
do to ensure that our apps stay safe and
secure.

8
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,010
So the first thing that Android does, is
whenever

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,150
you go and launch an app, as we've seen

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,200
before, that app has its own user account
associated

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,770
with it that determines what it can and
can't do.

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,560
But it also is launched in its own
process.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,539
So, your app is launched in its own
process,

14
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,230
and what a process does is it's an
operating

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,419
system construct that protects the memory
of your app, while

16
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:04,800
it's running, from the memory of other
applications.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,328
So your app will run in a process, and if
there's some malware that

18
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:13,390
might be trying to attack your app, it'll
be running in its own separate process.

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,710
So we'll have another process, and we'll
have your original process.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,685
Now what this means is, if your app's
memory is protected,

21
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:26,847
let's say that this is the I Remember app,
and we

22
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:31,015
have a variable that, for example, maybe
it's the server that

23
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:34,610
we're going to save data to or try to
login to.

24
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:41,300
So maybe we have a server variable defined
in one of our Java classes.

25
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,010
Well, what the processed memory
protections means is that the

26
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,960
second process can't go and directly write
to this variable.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,490
So this is not allowed.

28
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,720
That would be a violation of the security
that

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,730
processes provide to separate the memory
from each other.

30
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,010
Now, you can see why this is so important.

31
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,754
If this malware could go and directly
change

32
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:10,424
a variable in your code, for instance, if

33
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:13,168
it could go and change some variable
telling

34
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,628
where the I Remember app should log in.

35
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:19,698
And tell it to go and log in to another
server, for example, if you

36
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:22,436
go and capture your username and password,

37
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:25,190
and do all kinds of other malicious
things.

38
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:32,570
So, the memory protections that a process
provides are very important.

39
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,371
So, we get memory protection on our apps
from

40
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:40,380
other apps running on Android at the same
time.

41
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,024
Another very important thing that Android
provides

42
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:48,778
is it provides a guarantee on the storage

43
00:02:48,778 --> 00:02:54,890
of the things that your app will decides
or persists to the storage on the device.

44
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,480
So, what do we care about in this case?

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,190
Well, we care about that we can save state
for

46
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,790
our app because our app may not always be
running and

47
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,350
that when we go and relaunch that
application, we know that

48
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,320
that state will still be intact and in its
original condition.

49
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,904
So you can think about, for example, if

50
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,921
you were storing important data about the
state

51
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,033
of your app to disk and another app

52
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,260
could come in, overwrite that state, and
change it.

53
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,250
Then you could do a lot of very malicious
things from another app.

54
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,290
So it's very important that Android
protects whatever state

55
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,659
or information we save to the underlying
storage system.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:42,110
So, what types of state can we save that
are, get protected by Android?

57
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,330
Well the very first and important piece of
state that

58
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,420
we might save, for example, is the APK for
our app.

59
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,148
So, when we go and actually create an

60
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,932
app, we're creating a package that's going
to be

61
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:59,100
stored on the underlying file system on
the

62
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,130
device, that has all of our code in it.

63
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,120
So if another app could go and directly
manipulate our APK, it

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,190
could change the behavior of our app in
whatever way it wanted.

65
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,860
So it's very important that we protect

66
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,650
these APKs for our apps when they're
installed.

67
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,980
And Android does that for us.

68
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,800
It provides protections over the APKs of
each app.

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,990
So your app can't go and over write or
change another

70
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,680
app APK and those apps can't go and change
your app's APK.

71
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,140
What are other types of things that we
might want to store and protect?

72
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,940
Things like the database.

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,500
So if your app wants to store data in the
SQLite database on our device.

74
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,860
You can store that database, and Android,
depending on

75
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,150
how you store that data, and we'll talk
about

76
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,880
this, will protect that data so that only
your

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,260
app can read data in the database that
you're writing.

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,253
Other things that you might want to
persist are

79
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:03,550
settings for your app, and those can also
be persistent.

80
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,530
So how does Android go about actually
protecting these things under the hood?

81
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,138
Well the way that Android does it, as
we've seen

82
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:16,200
before is that each app has its own user
account.

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,410
And that essentially defines an area of
the

84
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,440
storage on the device that's assigned to
that app.

85
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,210
So if another app goes and tries to write
to this area of storage, it can't.

86
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,790
Because that's owned by that other app's
user account.

87
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,040
So by default, Android gives us two really
important things.

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,347
It gives us the ability to protect our
application's memory from other

89
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:45,670
apps running so they can't change our
variables or our run time state.

90
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,293
And then also it gives us the protect,
ability to protect the

91
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:55,210
data that we save to disc or to storage on
our device.

92
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,840
And that's protecting our state that's
persistent between launches.

93
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,371
So what Android's giving us is the ability

94
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:05,113
to protect our app, both when it's
running,

95
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:07,786
by protecting state that's in the process
of

96
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:10,597
that app, and then secondly, any state
that we

97
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:12,775
need to store, because it is a mobile

98
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:15,304
device, and apps get shut down from time
to

99
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:20,990
time, the, the battery on the phone dies,
and we need to be able to save state.

100
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,658
It protects all of that state that we
saved on the

101
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:27,810
underlying storage system in a special
area that's assigned to our app.
